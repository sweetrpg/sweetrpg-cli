# Release process

## Summary

1. Trigger the [**Prepare Release**](https://github.com/sweetrpg/catalog-cli/actions/workflows/prepare-release.yaml) workflow.
1. Merge PR to `master`.
1. Merge `master` into `develop`.

## Breakdown

Go modules have no `go.mod`-equivalent version field - a module's version comes entirely
from its git tag. Instead of writing the changelog by hand on the release branch, a
`prepare-release` workflow does it for you:

```sh
git checkout develop
git pull
```

Trigger the [**Prepare Release**](https://github.com/sweetrpg/catalog-cli/actions/workflows/prepare-release.yaml) workflow (`workflow_dispatch` in the Actions tab). It:

1. Runs `git-cliff --bump` against `develop` to determine the next version (e.g. `0.1.0`)
   from commits since the last tag.
2. Prepends the generated changelog section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Opens a PR from an auto-created `release/0.1.0` branch into `master`.

You review the PR (catch anything that shouldn't ship, fix as needed) - the
[**PR Validation**](https://github.com/sweetrpg/catalog-cli/actions/workflows/pr.yaml)
workflow runs against it - merge into `master`, which triggers tagging via the
[**Tag Release**](https://github.com/sweetrpg/catalog-cli/actions/workflows/tag-release.yaml)
workflow.

The tag push triggers the
[**Release**](https://github.com/sweetrpg/catalog-cli/actions/workflows/release.yaml)
workflow, which re-runs the test suite against the tagged commit, requests the new version
from the Go module proxy so `go get` and pkg.go.dev see it immediately, generates the
changelog scoped to that tag, attaches it to a GitHub Release, and merges `master` back
into `develop`.

## Triggering the run

Always pass `--ref develop` explicitly - `workflow_dispatch` otherwise defaults to
whichever branch is the repo's current default, and prepare-release must run against
`develop` regardless of what that setting is set to at the time:

```sh
gh workflow run prepare-release.yaml --ref develop
```

Or trigger it directly from the [Prepare Release workflow page](https://github.com/sweetrpg/catalog-cli/actions/workflows/prepare-release.yaml), selecting `develop` from the branch dropdown.
